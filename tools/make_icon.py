# Shared with Argus, which is where it was written: the four products draw the
# same icon and differ only in the letter, so this file is deliberately a copy
# rather than a variant. Change it in one place and copy it to the others.

"""Draw the application icon: the initial, in black, on white.

One letter, a serif face, a thin frame. The four products share the drawing
and differ only in the letter, so a taskbar with all four open reads as one
family rather than four unrelated programs.

The face is Liberation Serif, metric-compatible with Times New Roman and
redistributable; Times New Roman itself is neither free nor present on the
machines that build these. The output is committed rather than generated at
build time, so no release depends on which fonts a runner happens to have.

Every size is drawn for itself rather than scaled down from one master. A
frame that reads as a hairline at 256 pixels is a smear at 16, and the letter
that has room to breathe at 256 has to fill the square at 16 to be a letter at
all. Scaling one drawing gives the small sizes -- the ones actually on the
taskbar -- to whichever end of the range was drawn first.

The .ico is assembled here rather than by Pillow, for one reason: which
compression each frame uses. Pillow writes every frame as PNG. Windows has
accepted PNG frames since Vista, but the format every icon editor produces,
and the one the shell has always read, is an uncompressed DIB below 256 pixels
and PNG only for the 256 -- which is the size where PNG saves something worth
saving. Explorer showing a stale or generic icon for an executable whose
resources are demonstrably correct is exactly the shape of problem that
convention exists to avoid, so this writes the conventional thing.
